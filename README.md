# Scratchpad
A 2D and 3D game engine with fast prototyping capabilities and included editor. (*Hopefully)

It's a pet project of mine, that might eventually turn into something usable.
My goal here is to use as little third-party libraries as possible, for the sake of it and learning purposes.

## Modules
The project is split into multiple gradle submodules:
 - **core** - Core engine with all it's subsystems.
 - **standalone** - A Desktop implementation of the engine
 - **editor** - A desktop app full of tools for creating and editing projects that run on the Engine 
 - **config** - A small config library making use of reflection to automate the config file building.
 - **utility** - Various utility classes.
